a) 13, checked with a oneline graph.
b) 7:40pm, 9/23/2024.
c) A command like git rev-list -n 1 --before="2020-06-01" main would work.
d) There's no src file, but if we're talking about the .git file, I'm still not sure. I'm using git log --stat, but that seems like too much information to reasonably sort through.
e) None, there was no REMOVE.txt file in the github repo.
f) git log is a list of every commit made, while git status compares your working files with the repository and tells you what it's tracking and what it's not.
g) shortlog is the same as log, except it only includes the descriptions and the name of the person who made the commit.
h) git log --oneline -- Main.java
i) git log --follow -p -- Main.java
j) git log --grep="account"
k) git log --author="Author Name"
l) git log --author="Lauren" --since="2014-01-05" --until="2024-01-14"
