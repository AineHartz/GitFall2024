"It takes courage to grow up and become who you really are."

â€œYou have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. And you are the guy who'll decide where to go." 

"All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them."

"Champions keep playing until they get it right."

"It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light."
